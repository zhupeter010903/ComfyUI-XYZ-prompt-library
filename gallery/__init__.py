"""XYZ Image Gallery — assembly entry point (T01 skeleton).

This package is intentionally minimal at this stage: it only bootstraps the
on-disk data directory layout described in ``ARCHITECTURE §1`` and exposes the
``setup`` / ``start_background_services`` hooks that later tasks (T02+) will
fill in. No routes, no DB schema, no background threads yet.
